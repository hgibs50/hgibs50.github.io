<h1 id="ai-vs-ml-vs-big-data">“AI” vs “ML” vs “Big Data”</h1>
<p>This article is the first in a string of articles with a different
focus than security. With the frequency these terms appear on the
internet, you’d think there would be a consensus. I offer here a set of
definitions that follow the consensus that does exist, so you can
navigate past marketing and know what these words (should) mean.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h2>
<p>“AI” or Artificial Intelligence has become a broad term despite its
relatively simple and humble beginnings. The field of AI research began
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop">1950’s
at Dartmouth</a>, a time when computers took up rooms and huge amounts
of power. AI is simple to define:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is the ability for a machine to acquire,
understand, and use knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It stems from the term “Natural Intelligence”, the ability that many
living animals possess to acquire, understand, and use knowledge. AI is
just the synthetic corollary. There is no requirement for <em>how</em>
much understanding or how much knowledge is at play. Butterflies, for
example, exhibit intelligence by knowing which flowers to land on, and
how to fly in a way to avoid predators. Dolphins are also intelligent
and may possess other abilities, but it would be hard to argue that only
the dolphin possesses intelligence.</p>
<p>It is the same with AI. A computer that detects when to deploy an
airbag in your car balances the risk and cost of deploying the airbag
with the risk and cost of not deploying it at every moment you drive.
The airbag problem is one of the early uses of small computers to solve
an AI problem.</p>
<p>In short, all an AI system has to possess is an ability to do
something smart. It does not have to be “smart”.</p>
<p>The field of AI is actively researched and has many subcomponents:
Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Robotics, Natural Language
Processing, General Artificial Intelligence, etc.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ml">What is ML?</h2>
<p>“ML” / Machine Learning is a subset of principles in the realm of AI.
As opposed to AI, Machine Learning has a more specific and accepted
definition. This is my concise definition of ML:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Machine Learning is when a machine system teaches itself
knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell, ML is when a computer figures out something smart on
its own. This is a significant leap from AI, because it removes the step
of humans teaching the machine the intelligence. Typically, the human
specifies the <em>what</em> the system knows in an AI but non-ML
application, but defines the <em>how</em> the machine learns that
information in an ML application.</p>
<p>For an example, let us consider finding outliers in a dataset. This
may be useful for fraud detection, or malicious user detection. A
strictly AI solution would probably require a large set of rules and
statistical models to ascertain whether any data point (transaction,
software process, etc) is an anomaly. In security think about having to
keep your anti-virus up to date. Before the broad application of ML to
antivirus software, vendors had to maintain a huge list of bad programs
and tell your computer which ones to look out for (skipping over some
stuff here, but that’s the essence of it).</p>
<p>Now on the ML side: To find malicious software we can start with some
known good and known malcious software. We can feed them without much
else to a ML algorithm and the algorithm itself will determine which
aspects are most noteworthy. For instance, the algorithm could decide
that software downloaded from a specific website or that software
downloaded at certain times of day are much more likely to be malicious
and flag those applications all on its own. Some ML models are so
complex that they are nigh indecipherable on how they figure out the
rules as well, so these models can end up with highly robust, complex
models to find things in large datasets that humans simply cannot find
on their own.</p>
<p>In short, for AI the human developers had to know the rules up front
and define them. For ML, the computer determined those rules
themselves.</p>
<p>We will go into more detail about ML in future installments.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-big-data">What is big data?</h2>
<p>Big data is a relatively newer term referring to having datasets
larger than previously thought possible. A volume of data so large that
it is no longer possible to have a single machine do normal calculations
on them in the standard ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big data is when the amount of data exceeds the capacity of single
machines and requires deliberate approaches for processing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the data is too big for you or your organization to adequately
deal with on single computers, it has become big data. This means that
big data may mean 100GB of data to one company, but 100TB to
another.</p>
<p>For instance, anyone can average together a few thousand rows in
excel. It starts to get complicated when you have so many rows of data
that you can no longer fit that file on your computer, such as files
with billions of rows. This is even more pronounced when the amount of
data can’t fit into <strong>any</strong> single computer (or
server).</p>
<p>Another aspect of big data can be simply the speed at which it is
arriving. It isn’t terribly hard to process invoices or ship products
when they come in at a few orders per hour, but imagine trying to handle
millions of orders per second!</p>
<p>Big data is itself a problem (and a blessing). The methods we can use
to handle and deal with big data are infrastructural technologies. Some
examples are the Map-Reduce framework, or decentralized data stores. As
with all things of extreme scale, utilizing big data has it’s own set of
complexities. We will discuss some of these complexities and trade-offs
in future articles.</p>
<p>Big data relates to AI and ML in an important way. Often, it is
important to have large volumes of data used for training ML models.
With large data, analysts simply have a better chance of gaining new
insights or understandings of the population they are serving.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-these-fit-together">How do these fit together?</h1>
<p>This digram shows the intersection of AI, ML, big data, and some
other commonly related terms.</p>
<p><img src="venn_diagrams.png" /></p>
<p>Not all terms are included, but you can see the hierarchy between AI
and ML, as well as what things use big data. In general, the lower in
the hierarchy (i.e. circle inside of circles) the more precise a term
means.</p>
<p>This should also help with understanding the AI banner being almost
always just a catch-all term. All ML is AI, but not all AI is ML.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Hopefully this provides a bit more understanding to the often said
terms around AI and ML. AI is where computers do things “smartly”, ML is
where they figure ou t that “smartness” on their own, and big data is
when the scale of data is extre me.</p>
